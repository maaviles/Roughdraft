# What I Learned in ~~Boating~~ Coding School is...

a whole lot of kickass and how to be one.

### But Before That

Let me tell you a little bit about myself before Codefellows.  I came to the United States from the Philippines when I was 3.  My family moved around from Georgia to Alabama until we found ourselves in the ~~culuturally rich~~ corn fields of Missouri.  A couple years later we made our way back to Georgia. ~~Yay~~ Damn, fields and farms.

In High School and late middle school, I started dabbling in HTML and CSS on those long summer vacations.  I made silly little themes for xanga, myspace, and freewebs.  I spent hours mapping out elements in Photoshop and putting them in divs in divs in divs in divs *psst, and tables too!! ahhh!!*... I even use to make avatars for myself for my nerdy message boards.  I graduated from that and started designing logos, letterheads, and tshirts for nonprofits, family friend's businesses, school functions, anyone really who would let me.

I didn't necessarily know it at the time, but I found something I really loved.  I spent hours reading documentation on how to build websites and learning my tools and I loved it.  God forbid if I did any other reading that was actually required in school.  Even though, I did well for myself and graduated as one of the top students in my class.

And then I went to college and studied to go to Physical Therapy school.

**What The Fuck**. I Know.

### College
Almost a waste of my time and money, except for the amazing people and friends I met.  But I dropped off the face of my old world.  I stopped putting beta releases on my calender.  I stopped opening up those tools I worked so hard to get to know.  I stopped reading documentation.  I stopped learning to code.  I started doing medical things and just thinking fondly of my past.

I got sad and even clinically depressed during my college years.  I lost my way and motivation.  Drowning in academia, I needed out asap.  I made it 3.5 years.  The last year before I was going to graduate, I dropped out.

### And Then There Was [Codefellows](https://www.codefellows.org)

I moved to the west coast for the first time hoping to find something new.

I found CodeFellows at the end of their first year and signed up.
Here are some of my experiences with the classes I've taken and currently are in.

### iOS Evening Class
This was my first real back-end programming environment.  I didn't sleep.

Before this class I prepared by reading and practicing some.  I realized I hadn't touched anything for years.  Really, I had no idea what I was getting myself into but I was ready to learn - and learn I did. A lot of it.

The first day I learned my way around github and terminal.  Not one single line of code, and I was knee deep in millions of tabs.  I had no idea what Forking was or Pushing or Pulling. What? Don't even get me started when we brought Objective-C in the picture.

This was the trend for pretty much the whole class. No sleep, lots of reading, videos, emails, and errors.  It was hard and mentally and emotional taxing for me.

But I loved it.

Every time my app crashed I tried something new until it worked.  That golden moment when everything works - it's beautiful and worth the journey.

**Some of the biggest none coding things I learned in this class are:**

* Keep going.  If you don't get it 100% now then that's ok! Just try it out and keep going.
* Ask for help. Don't feel dumb for asking. Most of the time there's someone else who has the same question.
* Know where to look for help. Use stackoverflow and reliable documentation.  Throughout the class, we were able to share lots of great resources.
* Social networking, it can be your best friend.
* Diligence!
* If you love it, do it. Everything else will follow.
* Github, I can't believe I didn't know it before now.

I'm far from being an iOS Dev, but this class made me comfortable with the tools and the processes that goes with making iOS apps.  

### UXE Evening Class & Bootcamp

I really enjoyed the iOS class and was actually planning on doing the iOS Bootcamp.  There was one thing I really missed though, design.  All my apps I did for Homework looked like shithole.  Everything worked though; I took pictures on my iPhone, my app put filters and other stickers on them, but damn did those interfaces look bad. Then I saw this golden turkey and immediately wanted in. It brought back those old memories of geocities and photoshop.

Codefellows and my teacher, [Dale Sande](https://twitter.com/anotheruiguy), were awesome and let me take both of classes if I did well in the evening class.  Currently the evening class is over, and I've just completed the first week of the bootcamp.

There's still so much to learn and so much to cover but here are

**Some of the biggest none coding things I've learned in this class so far:**

* You'll never know something 100%. You'll just be a snob who doesn't want to learn anymore.
* Twitter, it can be your best friend.
* Write, write, write! Write code, write a blog, just don't stop writing!
* Dale Sande can smell bullshit a mile away :p
* If you like a certain concept, dive deeper and find what you really want to get into!  I really love flexboxes right now. I can't stop making them and playing with them.

###Conclusions

Excitement is the only word I can use to describe how I feel about my experiences.  I can't wait to see what else is down the road for me.

Look out for more posts about the class!
